## Process
- Inorder to get the model to generate a bayesian network, I decided to
  ask it a set of questions.
- Using these questions, I ask the models to give us the bayesian network
  in python, which can later be tested on our respective PCs.
- Finally, I analyse these answers and verify if they are accurate and similar.
