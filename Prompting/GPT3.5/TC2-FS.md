## New Test Case Solution

Given the conditions:

- Labour quality is unskilled: Unskilled labor may lead to challenges in meeting orders accurately and on time.

- Back orders are low: With a low number of back orders, the company has the flexibility to focus on fulfilling 
new orders.

- Lead times are high: High lead times indicate potential delays in restocking and fulfilling orders.

- Reorder point is near: A near reorder point suggests that the company can quickly replenish inventory when needed, 
but the high lead times may pose challenges.

- Available capital is low: Low available capital limits the company's ability to invest in additional inventory or 
expedite procurement processes.

- Forecasted demands are high: High forecasted demands mean a significant number of orders to fulfill.

- Current inventory is high: Despite high current inventory, the challenges lie in the unskilled labor, 
high lead times, and low available capital.

- Safety stock is medium: Medium safety stock provides a moderate level of precaution against unexpected 
fluctuations in demand.

Considering these factors, the company is likely to face challenges in meeting the high forecasted demands due to
the combination of unskilled labor, high lead times, and low available capital. The near reorder point provides some 
relief, but the overall conditions suggest a higher probability of under-stocking and potential stock-out situations. 

The company may struggle to keep up with the demand, especially considering the limitations in labor quality, capital, 
and lead times. Over-stocking is less probable due to the low available capital and the challenges associated with 
high lead times.
