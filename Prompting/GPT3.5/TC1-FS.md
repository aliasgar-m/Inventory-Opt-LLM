## New Test Case Solution
Given the conditions:

- Labour quality is semi-skilled: While not as precise as skilled labor, semi-skilled labor can still handle 
orders reasonably well.

- Back orders are medium: There is a moderate number of back orders, indicating a manageable workload.

- Lead times are low: Low lead times make procurement and restocking efficient.

- Reorder point is near: A near reorder point suggests that the company can quickly replenish inventory when needed.

- Available capital is medium: Moderate capital implies the company has some financial flexibility, but it 
may need to be cautious with investments.

- Forecasted demands are medium: Moderate forecasted demands indicate a balanced market demand, neither exceptionally 
high nor low.

- Current inventory is high: Having a high current inventory provides a buffer and allows the company to fulfill 
orders promptly.

- Safety stock is medium: Moderate safety stock implies a reasonable level of precaution against unexpected 
fluctuations in demand.

Considering these factors, the company is likely to maintain a balanced inventory level. The combination of 
semi-skilled labor, moderate back orders, low lead times, and a high current inventory allows for effective order 
fulfillment. The near reorder point and moderate available capital provide the company with the means to replenish 
stock as needed. 

The overall conditions suggest that the company is less likely to experience over-stocking, 
under-stocking, or stock-out. Instead, it can maintain a stable and responsive inventory management strategy.
