Given the conditions you've provided, it is likely that the company will experience over-stocking. Here's why:

1. **Labour quality is skilled:** Skilled labor typically implies efficiency in production and inventory management. 
This can lead to better control over the production process and inventory levels.

2. **Back orders are high:** High back orders indicate that the company is producing more than the current demand. 
This suggests a potential for over-stocking.

3. **Lead times are low:** Low lead times mean that the company can quickly restock items, making it easier to 
respond to changes in demand. This could contribute to over-stocking if production is not adjusted according to 
actual demand.

4. **Reorder point is near:** A near reorder point implies that the company places new orders when inventory levels 
are still relatively high. If the demand is low, this may result in over-stocking.

5. **Available capital is high:** High available capital allows the company to invest in larger inventory quantities, 
which may contribute to over-stocking if demand is not accurately forecasted.

6. **Forecasted demands are low:** Low forecasted demands suggest that the company may be producing more than 
necessary, leading to a surplus of inventory.

7. **Current inventory is high:** High current inventory levels, especially when combined with low forecasted 
demands, indicate a risk of over-stocking if production is not adjusted accordingly.

8. **Safety stock is low:** Low safety stock means there is less buffer to absorb fluctuations in demand. If the 
company is not closely monitoring and adjusting production, it may lead to over-stocking.

Taking these conditions into account, it is probable that the company will experience over-stocking due to high 
production levels and inventory quantities relative to the low forecasted demands. Efficient inventory management 
practices, accurate demand forecasting, and production adjustments are crucial to avoid over-stocking in this scenario.
