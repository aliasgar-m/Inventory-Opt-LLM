Given the conditions you've provided, it is likely that the company will experience under-stocking or stock-out 
situations. Here's why:

1. **Labour quality is unskilled:** Unskilled labor may lead to inefficiencies in production and stocking processes, 
making it challenging to keep up with demand or manage inventory effectively.

2. **Back orders are high:** High back orders indicate that demand is not being met in a timely manner. 
This may result in a situation where the company struggles to fulfill customer orders promptly.

3. **Lead times are high:** High lead times mean that it takes a significant amount of time to restock items once 
they are depleted. This increases the risk of stock-outs during periods of high demand.

4. **Reorder point is far:** A far reorder point implies that the company allows inventory to deplete significantly 
before placing new orders. This increases the likelihood of stock-outs, especially when demand is high.

5. **Available capital is medium:** A medium level of available capital may limit the company's ability to invest 
in larger inventory quantities to meet high forecasted demands or buffer against uncertainties.

6. **Forecasted demands are high:** High forecasted demands, combined with other factors like high back orders and 
low current inventory, suggest that the company may struggle to keep up with the expected demand.

7. **Current inventory is low:** Low current inventory levels, along with high forecasted demands, indicate that the 
company is not adequately stocked to meet customer needs.

8. **Safety stock is high:** While safety stock is high, the combination of low current inventory and high forecasted 
demands may still lead to stock-outs if the replenishment process is not efficient.

Considering these conditions, it's probable that the company will face challenges in maintaining adequate inventory 
levels to meet customer demand, leading to under-stocking or stock-out situations.
