The company is most likely experiencing under-stocking.

Here's the breakdown:

* High back orders: This indicates that the company has not been able to meet customer demand in the past.
* Low lead times: This means that the company can get new inventory quickly.
* Reorder point is near: This suggests that the company is close to running out of inventory.
* High available capital: This means that the company can afford to purchase more inventory.
* Low forecasted demands: This indicates that the company expects demand to be low in the future.
* High current inventory: This means that the company currently has a lot of inventory on hand.
* Low safety stock: This suggests that the company does not have a lot of buffer inventory to protect against 
unexpected increases in demand.

Given these conditions, it is most likely that the company is experiencing under-stocking. This means that 
they do not have enough inventory on hand to meet current demand, and they are at risk of running out of 
stock in the future.

Here are some additional factors that could affect the company's stock status:

* The variability of demand: If demand is highly variable, the company may need to keep more safety 
stock to avoid stock-outs.
* The cost of holding inventory: The company needs to weigh the cost of holding excess inventory against 
the cost of stock-outs.
* The company's risk tolerance: Some companies are more risk-averse than others and may be willing to hold 
more inventory to avoid stock-outs.

Overall, the company's stock status is a complex issue that depends on a number of factors. However, 
based on the information provided, it is most likely that the company is experiencing under-stocking.
