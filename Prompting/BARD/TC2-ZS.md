The company is most likely experiencing over-stocking.

Here's the breakdown:

* High back orders: This indicates that the company has not been able to meet customer demand in the past.
* High lead times: This means that the company cannot get new inventory quickly.
* Reorder point is far: This suggests that the company has plenty of time to order new inventory 
before they run out.
* Medium available capital: This means that the company may need to be careful about how much inventory 
they purchase.
* High forecasted demands: This indicates that the company expects demand to be high in the future.
* Low current inventory: This means that the company does not currently have a lot of inventory on hand.
* High safety stock: This suggests that the company has a lot of buffer inventory to protect against unexpected 
increases in demand.

Given these conditions, it is most likely that the company is experiencing over-stocking. This means that 
they have more inventory on hand than they need to meet current demand, and they are at risk of incurring 
carrying costs such as storage and insurance.

Here are some additional factors that could affect the company's stock status:

* The variability of demand: If demand is highly variable, the company may need to keep more safety 
stock to avoid stock-outs, even if it means carrying more inventory than necessary.
* The cost of holding inventory: The company needs to weigh the cost of holding excess inventory against 
the cost of stock-outs and potential lost sales.
* The company's risk tolerance: Some companies are more risk-averse than others and may be willing to hold 
more inventory to avoid stock-outs, even if it means higher carrying costs.

Overall, the company's stock status is a complex issue that depends on a number of factors. However, 
based on the information provided, it is most likely that the company is experiencing over-stocking.
